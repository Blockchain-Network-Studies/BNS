This repository contains the replicable data and code for research entitled "Is decentralized finance actually decentralized? A social network analysis of the Aave protocol on the Ethereum blockchain."

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) has the potential to disrupt centralized finance by validating peer-to-peer transactions through tamper-proof smart contracts, thus significantly lowering the transaction cost charged by financial intermediaries. However, the actual realization of peer-to-peer transactions and the levels and effects of decentralization are largely unknown. Our research pioneers a blockchain network study that applies social network analysis to measure the level, dynamics, and impacts of decentralization in DeFi token transactions on the Ethereum blockchain...</p>
